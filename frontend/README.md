### Problem
A concerning trend is emerging in Batakaheritagecentre, where the younger generation is gradually forgetting their cultural heritage and traditions. This decline in cultural knowledge is evident across generations, with each successive generation possessing less knowledge than the previous one. For instance, the amount of cultural knowledge possessed by grandparents is significantly more than that of their children, and the cultural knowledge of today's youth is likely to be even less than that of their parents. If this trend continues, there is a risk that the cultural heritage may eventually disappear from the society. This loss would not only erase the region's rich cultural identity but also deprive future generations of their cultural roots and traditions.

To address this problem, we have come up with a solution to digitize this cultural knowledge. Since today's generation is more comfortable with technology, we aim to provide a platform where they can learn about their cultural heritage using their devices, from anywhere in the world. By doing so, we hope to make cultural knowledge more accessible and engaging for the younger generation, and thus help preserve the rich cultural heritage of Batakaheritagecentre.
